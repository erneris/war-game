# war-game
This is a recreation of a simple card game War, typically played by two players using a standard playing card deck.

# Requirements
  * Application creates a card deck, which is evenly split between two players.
  * Two players reveal their cards and the one with highest one takes both and places them in the end of their deck.
  * In case of tie both players place the next card from their pile face down and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to     the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher    than their opponent's.
  * Player loses when he runs out of cards.
  * Project should utilise Python OOP.
